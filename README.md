# Happy Numbers 2
Client-side calculation. No POST. Fully responsive

## Why?
Because the one I had kept crashing, and all the processing could be done client side anyway. There is no database access, and an opportuinity to make it visually interesting.

## Why Not React, or Knockout?
Sometimes the simpliest way is the best. I could have possibly done it without jQuery, but that is for a future version possibly. Maybe I'll fork it later.

## What is a happy number?
Take a number, split it into digits and sum the squares of each digit.

Repeat this until you either

* Loop indefinitly (unhappy)
* End up at 1 (happy)
